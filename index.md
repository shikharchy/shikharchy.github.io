**Hello!!!**

Thank you for visiting my academic website. <br/>

I am currently studying Bachelor of Science in Information Technology at [University of Vavuniya,Srilanka]. I finished my Secondary education from Columbus Higher Secondary School,Nepal.<br/>

I am broadly interested in different forms of artificial intelligence that carry out the assigned tasks robustly and reliably. In an **unsorted list**, I spend most of my time on:

* Lifelong Human-Robot Interaction
* Deep Learning and its Uncertainty & Robustness
* AI solutions for Social Goods and Climate Change

Apart from above, I frequently autodidactic myself ranging from philosophy (currently exploring **Stoic**) to economics (currently exploring **social choice theory**).


<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Stay Tuned. More updates are coming pretty soon. :)
