Hey there, thank you for visiting my website. <br/>

I am an M.S. student in Electrical and Computer Engineering at [Sungkyunkwan University] advised by Prof. Juneho Yi at [Computer Vision Lab]. Prior to Joining Sungkyunkwan, I received my Bachelor's in Electronics and Communication Engineering from [Pokhara University].<br/>

I am broadly interested in different forms of artificial intelligence that carry out the assigned tasks robustly and reliably. In an unsorted list, my research interest lies in:
* Multiagent Systems
* Optimization
* Decision making
* Deep learning and its uncertainty & robustness
* Understanding the relationship between language and vision in humans
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Stay Tuned. More updates are coming. :)
