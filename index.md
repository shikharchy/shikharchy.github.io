Hey there! <br/>

I graduated with Master's of Science in Electrical and Computer Engineering from [Sungkyunkwan University] under the supervision of Prof. Juneho Yi at [Computer Vision Lab].  Prior to Joining Sungkyunkwan, I received my Bachelor's in Electronics and Communication Engineering from [Pokhara University].<br/>

I am broadly interested in different forms of artificial intelligence that carry out the assigned tasks robustly and reliably. In an **unsorted list**, I spend most of my research time in:
* Life-Long Human Robot Interation.
* Deep Learning and its Uncertainty & Robustness.
* AI solutions for Social Goods and Climate Change.

Apart from above, I frequently autodidactic myself ranging from philosphy (currently exploring **Stoic**) to economics (currently exploring **social choice theory**).

<br/>
Stay Tuned. More updates are coming pretty soon. :)
