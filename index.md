Hey there, thank you for visiting my website. <br/>

I graduated with Master's of Science in Electrical and Computer Engineering from [Sungkyunkwan University] under the supervision of Prof. Juneho Yi at [Computer Vision Lab].  Prior to Joining Sungkyunkwan, I received my Bachelor's in Electronics and Communication Engineering from [Pokhara University].<br/>

I am broadly interested in different forms of artificial intelligence that carry out the assigned tasks robustly and reliably. In an unsorted list, my research interest lies in:
* Fairness and Trustworthy AI
* Multiagent Systems and optimization
* Deep learning and its uncertainty & robustness
* Understanding the relationship between language and vision in humans

<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Stay Tuned. More updates are coming. :)
