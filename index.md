Hey there! <br/>

I graduated with a Master's of Science in Electrical and Computer Engineering from [Sungkyunkwan University] under the supervision of Prof. Juneho Yi at [Computer Vision Lab].  Prior to Joining Sungkyunkwan, I received my Bachelor's in Electronics and Communication Engineering from [Pokhara University].<br/>

I am broadly interested in different forms of artificial intelligence that carry out the assigned tasks robustly and reliably. In an **unsorted list**, I spend most of my research on:
* Life-Long Human-Robot Interaction: Taking inspiration from "How do human learn different multiple related topics concurrently? How do human learn while interaction with another human? How do human learn new topics with the help of previously gained knowledge in a continual manner?" to exploring solution to can we make social robots learn multiple topics simultaneously? and/or can we make social robots learn by interaction with other human/robot? and/or can social robots learn new task/attributes in a continual manner in real work?
* Deep Learning and its Uncertainty & Robustness.
* AI solutions for Social Goods and Climate Change.

Apart from above, I frequently autodidactic myself ranging from philosophy (currently exploring **Stoic**) to economics (currently exploring **social choice theory**).

Stay Tuned. More updates are coming pretty soon. :)
